Today I would like to share the coding interview questions with Python using MarkDown format, which is clean and easy to polish in the future. This repository [Coding Algorithm Questions](https://github.com/wangruinju/Coding-Algorithm-Questions) is targeted for **Intermediate** or **Advanced** level.

For **Beginner** level, you can refer to my another repository [Rui_Python_Leetcode](https://github.com/wangruinju/Rui_Python_Leetcode).

# MarkDown

I love to use [**Typora**](https://typora.io/) to save solutions that have been passed on Online Judgement in [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) platform.
